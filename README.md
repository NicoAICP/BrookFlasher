# BrookFlasher
BrookFlasher is a tool that allows you to flash the Firmware of your Brook Wingman XB2 and XB3.
This Tool can downgrade your Brook Wingman to older Versions!

Other Brook Devices have not been tested.
If you Flash a wrong Firmware to your Wingman it will stay in DFU mode and can be restored by flashing the current Firmware, or using the Original Updater.

For Usage you just have to Put the Firmware (in .hex format) in the same folder as the BrookFlasher, connect your Wingman in DFU mode to your PC, and run the Flasher.
After that just follow onscreen Instructions.

I am not responsible for any damages.
